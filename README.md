# esp-hub75

Drive HUB75 displays from ESP32 series SOCs.

**WARNING**: This is currently a very early WORK IN PROGRESS!

**WARNING**: For now the `esp-hal` version required is not released yet this is pinned to a specific git commit.

All implementations use DMA where supported.

- [ ] - documentation!
- [x] - GPIO rudimentary brute force
- [x] - LCD peripheral  (async) for: `esp32s3`
  - [ ] - sync support for LCD peripheral
- [ ] - I2S peripheral in LCD mode: `esp32`
- [ ] - PARL_IO peripheral: `esp32c6`

## Notes

- To drive HUB75 displays reliably you need a level converter between the GPIOs and the HUB75.

## Examples

### [lcd_cam](examples/lcd_cam.rs)

Will display  a red/green/blue gradient on the top 24 lines and some rendering and refresh stats at the bottom.
Expects a 64x64 matrix.

### [gpio](examples/gpio.rs) (currently broken!)

Will display wade vertical bars of red/green/blue.
