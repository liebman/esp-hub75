A `no-std` Rust driver for HUB75-style LED matrix panels on ESP32-series
microcontrollers. HUB75 is a standard interface for driving large, bright,
and colorful RGB LED displays, commonly used in digital signage and art
installations.

This library provides a high-performance implementation that uses Direct
Memory Access (DMA) to drive the display with minimal CPU overhead. It is
designed to work with a variety of ESP32 models, using the most efficient
peripheral available on each chip:

- **ESP32-S3**: Uses the LCD_CAM peripheral
- **ESP32-C6**: Uses the PARL_IO peripheral
- **ESP32**: Uses the I2S peripheral in parallel mode

The driver is built on top of the `embedded-graphics` crate, allowing you to
easily draw shapes, text, and images on the display. It also uses a zero-copy
framebuffer for efficient memory usage.

## Hardware Requirements

- An ESP32-series microcontroller (ESP32, ESP32-S3, or ESP32-C6)
- A HUB75 LED matrix panel
- A 5V power supply capable of providing several amps of current
- A 3.3V to 5V level shifter (e.g., 74HCT245) is highly recommended

**Note**: The ESP32 operates at 3.3V, while HUB75 panels require 5V logic
signals. While it may sometimes work without one, using a level shifter
ensures reliable operation and prevents damage to your hardware.

## Pin Configurations

This driver supports two types of HUB75 pin configurations, which you can
select based on your hardware setup:

- **`Hub75Pins16` (Direct Drive)**: This is the standard configuration where
  the row address lines are sent with every pixel. It requires more GPIO
  pins but works with any standard HUB75 panel.

- **`Hub75Pins8` (Latched)**: This configuration is for controller boards that
  include an external 74HC574-style latch for the row address lines. This is
  more memory-efficient and requires fewer GPIO pins. For more details on the
  required circuit, see the [`hub75-framebuffer` crate's documentation](https://crates.io/crates/hub75-framebuffer)
  or its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/liebman/hub75-framebuffer).

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate how to use this crate with different ESP32
variants.

### ESP32-S3 (LCD_CAM Interface)

- [`examples/hello_lcd_cam`](examples/hello_lcd_cam.rs) - Displays "Hello, World!".
- [`examples/lcd_cam.rs`](examples/lcd_cam.rs) - Shows a color gradient and stats.
- [`examples/lcd_cam_tiled.rs`](examples/lcd_cam_tiled.rs) - uses 4 64x32 panels
  in a 2x2 configuration to show a color gradient and stats

### ESP32-C6 (PARL_IO Interface)

- [`examples/hello_parl_io.rs`](examples/hello_parl_io.rs) - Displays "Hello, World!".
- [`examples/parl_io.rs`](examples/parl_io.rs) - Shows a color gradient and stats.

### ESP32 (I2S Parallel Interface)

- [`examples/hello_i2s_parallel.rs`](examples/hello_i2s_parallel.rs) - Displays
  "Hello, World!".
- [`examples/i2s_parallel.rs`](examples/i2s_parallel.rs) - Shows a color gradient
  and stats.
- [`examples/i2s_parallel_latch.rs`](examples/i2s_parallel_latch.rs) - Shows a
  color gradient and stats.
- [`examples/i2s_parallel_dimming.rs`](examples/i2s_parallel_dimming.rs) - Shows
  a color gradient and stats.

## Crate Features

- `esp32`: Enable support for the ESP32
- `esp32s3`: Enable support for the ESP32-S3
- `esp32c6`: Enable support for the ESP32-C6
- `defmt`: Enable logging with `defmt`
- `log`: Enable logging with the `log` crate
- `invert-blank`: Invert the blank signal, required for some controller boards.
- `skip-black-pixels`: Forwards to the `hub75-framebuffer` crate, enabling an
  optimization that skips writing black pixels to the framebuffer.
- `iram`: Place the driver’s hot-path (render / DMA wait functions) in
  Instruction RAM (IRAM) to avoid flash-cache stalls (for example during
  Wi-Fi, PSRAM, or SPI-flash activity) that can cause visible flicker.
  Enabling this feature consumes roughly 5–10 KiB of IRAM.
